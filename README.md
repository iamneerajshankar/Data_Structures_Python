# Topic-Arrays in Data Structure
## Getting Started

## About this repository:
Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple 
items of the same type together.

This repository contains Java programs demonstrating various types of operations performed on arrays like
Insertion, Deletion, sorting algorithms, etc.

## Running The code 
  ### Prerequisite
    Make sure the python is installed on the system

  ### How to run using cmd or terminal

    To run the program on Linux - python3 filename.py
    To run the program windows - python3 filename.py

## List of programs:
#### 1. UnderstandingTheArray - demonstrates, how the arrays can be created and traversed.
#### 2. ArrayInsertion - insert an element or item in already created array at a given index
#### 3. ArrayDeletion - deletes an element or item from already created array at a given index
#### 4. BubbleSortAlgorithm - Time Complexity - O(n^2), stable algorithm , not adaptive but can be made adaptive
#### 5. InsertionSortAlgorithm - Time Complexity- O(n2) in the worst case and O(n) in the best case, stable algorithm, adaptive and not recursive algorithm
#### 6. SelectionSortAlgorithm - Time Complexity- O(n2), not a stable algorithm, not a recursive algorithm and not an adaptive algorithm
#### 7. QuickSortAlgorithm - Time complexity- worst case- O(n2), when the array is already sorted, best case-O(nlogn), not stable algorithm, not adaptive, recursive algorithm
